      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I started my education at a public school called Brooklands Elementary School that was within walking distance of my house. My favorite thing about going to Brooklands was that all of 
          my school friends lived in my neighborhood or close by. When my dad suggested that I apply to The Roeper School, I was hesitant to leave mainly because I would miss my 
          friends that I had known since kindergarten. This was why I did not end up transferring for 4th grade and decided to hold off until 5th. Ultimately this was one of the best decisions 
          that I've made. Roeper allowed me to be challenged and engaged in my learning and be a part of a tight-knit community that supported me through my senior year and beyond. My time at 
          Roeper played a large role in forming who I am today. Their philosophy praises teaching the whole child, not simply grooming applicants for college admissions or standardized tests. 
          The small size and general no-cut policy allowed me to try different things and be involved in as many extra-curriculars as I'd like. I cherish each opportunity I've had and attempt to 
          pay it forward by helping where I can, whether it be tutoring a student in my free time, or becoming a Teaching Assistant for a course, or simply being a good friend. This goal drives 
          me, I truly enjoy being helpful.
