      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering double major at Washington University in St. Louis who loves
        to play bass guitar and teach.

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I started my education at a public school called Brooklands Elementary School that was within walking
        distance of my house. My favorite thing about going to Brooklands was that all of
        my school friends lived in my neighborhood or close by. When my dad suggested that I apply to The Roeper
        School, a school for gifted children, I was hesitant to leave mainly because I would miss my
        friends that I had known since kindergarten. This was why I did not end up transferring for 4th grade
        and decided to hold off until 5th. Transferring to Roeper was ultimately one of
        the best decisions that I've made. Roeper allowed me to be challenged and engaged in my learning and be
        a part of a tight-knit community that supported me through my senior year and beyond.
        My time at Roeper played a large role in forming who I am today. Their philosophy praises teaching the
        whole child, not simply grooming applicants for college admissions or standardized tests.
        The small size and general no-cut policy allowed me to try different things and be involved in as many
        extra-curriculars as I'd like, including an activity called Forensics, which is basically competitive
        performing and public speaking. I cherish each opportunity I've had and attempt to
        pay it forward by helping where I can, whether it be tutoring a student in my free time, or becoming a
        Teaching Assistant for a course, or simply being a good friend. This goal drives
        me, I truly enjoy being helpful.

      <h2>My Music</h2>
      <p>Music is a huge part of who I am. When I was a toddler my family would go to the Detroit Symphony
        Orchestra's Children's Concert Series and my mom tells me stories of how
        I would always want to dance around and stomp my feet to the rhythms from the perscussion section. Music
        was and is something that I can feel, the emotion and energy of
        a piece never fails to move me. When I was eight, I stopped only appreciating music and started to learn
        how to make some of my own. I started off learning guitar and then
        over the years I picked up drums and percussion, vocals, bass guitar, and eventually double bass too.
        I've been a part of various groups like Jazz Band, Chamber Strings,
        Concert Band, Concert Choir, and an acapella group called Small Choir. Along with the in-school
        ensembles I've also played in the orchestra pit for 5 different
        productions. It became a running theme that if I wasn't on the stage acting, I was probably in the pit.
        Now that I'm in college it has become slightly harder to be as
        involved in all the artistic things that I love but I am still in the Jazz Band and have even been
        playing in my own band called <strong>IMAS</strong>. We placed second
        in a Battle of the Jams competition and would have been able to open for a big concert later in the
        semester had the COVID-19 pandemic not forced all of the universities
        to switch to remote learning.
